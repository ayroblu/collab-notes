Collab Notes
============

Uses Monaco (the editor from VS Code), WebRTC so that all communication happens peer to peer, and Yjs for synchronised editing

TODO

### MVP
- order styles
- design language (hover v active / focused etc)
- comments?
- editor selection doesn't work due to react rendering

### Longer term
- minify webpack
- gdoc / gdrive sync
- dropbox sync
- output files
- local file sync
- whiteboard?
- image uploads?
