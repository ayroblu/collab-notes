Collab Notes
============

Uses Monaco (the editor from VS Code), WebRTC so that all communication happens peer to peer, and Yjs for synchronised editing

TODO

### MVP
- comments v2
  - on click if scroll required, scroll page to where comment actually is
  - notifications for when you have new comments / threads
  - collapse comments
  - "resolve" comments - menu?
  - scroll comments too as part of line restoration
- playwright testing

### Longer term
- migrate to create react app
- rollback history
- gdoc / gdrive sync
- dropbox sync
- output files
- local file sync
- whiteboard?
- image uploads?
- design language (hover v active / focused etc)
- try have a really big editor, with normal scrolling?
- performance
