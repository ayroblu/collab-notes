### MVP
- comments
  - switch to settings + switch back, comments are overlaid
  - Add threads to comments
  - Focus highlights + selection highlights
    - Focus on comment focuses selection too
  - selection when adjusting text
- decoration size changes

### Longer term
- performance - it takes 5+ seconds to load locally!!
- minify webpack
- gdoc / gdrive sync
- dropbox sync
- output files
- local file sync
- whiteboard?

- design language (hover v active / focused etc)
