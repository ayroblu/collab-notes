Collab Notes
============

Uses Monaco (the editor from VS Code), WebRTC so that all communication happens peer to peer, and Yjs for synchronised editing

### MVP
- comments v2
  - collapse comments
  - Dropdown menu top next to facepile - checkboxes for resolved, open
    - Stats for num resolved, open
    - Buttons to collapse all and expand all
    - jump to next comment (maybe next new comment in the future)
  - on click if scroll required, scroll page to where comment actually is
  - scroll comments too as part of line restoration
- comments v3
  - what is "new" - has "focused" ever - only matters if you've ever commented before

### Longer term
- rollback history
- gdoc / gdrive sync
- dropbox sync
- output files
- local file sync
- whiteboard?
- image uploads?
- design language (hover v active / focused etc)
- try have a really big editor, with normal scrolling?
