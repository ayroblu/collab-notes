Collab Notes
============

Uses Monaco (the editor from VS Code), WebRTC so that all communication happens peer to peer, and Yjs for synchronised editing

TODO
----
### MVP
- comments
  - Focus highlights + selection highlights - make prettier?
  - hover effect - use fainter border
  - on click if scroll required, scroll page to where comment actually is
  - separte button to create comment into its own scoll section
- Focus comments when cursor moves to highlight (remove the click handler)
- "resolve" comments - menu?
- refactor new room, and new file experience, no longer autojoin

### Longer term
- performance - it takes 5+ seconds to load locally!!
- minify webpack
- gdoc / gdrive sync
- dropbox sync
- output files
- local file sync
- whiteboard?
- image uploads?
- design language (hover v active / focused etc)
