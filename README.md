Collab Notes
============

Uses Monaco (the editor from VS Code), WebRTC so that all communication happens peer to peer, and Yjs for synchronised editing

TODO

### MVP
- React router - different files + settings
- Files manager - just a list? no directories, may add "tags" later
- Set name at start?
- Support change file type
- Support change theme
- Support configure vim / .vimrc
- save to indexeddb
- setup eslint

### Longer term
- gdoc / gdrive sync
- dropbox sync
- output files
- local file sync
